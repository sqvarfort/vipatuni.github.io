<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to VIP@Uni!</h3>

<p>This website contains stories and experiences of people with varying degrees of vision loss who are studying or have completed a post-secondary program at a college. Our hope is to inspire others to take up university studies, and to provide practical advice to those who are already enrolled. Therefore, we also  welcome feedback from you with similar experiences. Obviously, the website is also meant for those who have responsibility for and the ability to contribute to the successful studies of people with visual impairment. Your comments and questions are welcome. </p>

<p> In order for you, the reader to understand and hopefully benefit from our stories and experiences, we have created personal profiles belonging to former or current students to this website. The profiles describe the nature and degree of visual impairment, and the area of study, ie, the university degree course. Our purpose is to clearly describe our different conditions and to explain how we tackled various obstacles that arose while studying at university. We would like to emphasize the fact that even though certain obstacles might seem similar, a general solution is typically not available, and each visually impaired student has come up with their own approach. </p>
